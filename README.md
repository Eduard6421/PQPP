## About <a name = "about"></a>
This repository hosts the annotated dataset and the implementations of the prediction models described in the original paper.
This file also hosts the extended benchmark, including models which did not pass a minimum correlation threshold of 0.1.

    
    \PQPP
        \dataset - folder containing the annotated dataset
            \ all_users_ann_new.csv - Original generative setting annotations. Anonymized file
            \ avg_scores_mrr.pickle - Average RR for each query in the retrieval setting.
            \ avg_scores_p10.pickle - Average P@10 for each query in the retrieval setting.
            \ best_captions_df.pickle - File containing extra information about each query caption
